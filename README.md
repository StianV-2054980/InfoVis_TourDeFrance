# InfoVis_TourDeFrance
## Information
Welcome to the Tour de France (TdF) statistics website! With this project I try to visualise the data of the Tour de France in a clear and interactive way. The data ranges over the whole history of the Tour de France, starting from 1903 until 2022. For more information about the race itself, check out [TdF information](https://www.letour.fr/en/).

## Me
I am Stian Verherstraeten, a student in the master of Computer Science at the University of Hasselt. I am a really big fan of cycling, which is why I decided to make this project of the 'Information Visualisation' course about the Tour de France. Not only for myself, to see learn more about the history and trends throughout the time, but also for other people so they can learn more about cycling (and hopefully get interested).

## Data
The data is collected from the Maven Tour de France challenge. And can be downloaded through [this link](https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-tour-de-france-challenge/4cf1cbec-e206-4f42-8725-dfea9ab38aa1).
